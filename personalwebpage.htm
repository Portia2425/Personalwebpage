                    All New Zealanders deserve safe, reliable and affordable water services that support good health <br> 
                    and sustainable environmental outcomes. <br><br> 
                    But, Aotearoa’s drinking water, wastewater and stormwater - our three waters - networks are facing a crisis <br> 
                    and will continue to do so without big changes.
                    <br><br>The Government, working with councils, is proposing to build a better system for our three waters that is <br> 
                    still owned by the communities it serves. <br><br>
                    Better water is better for everyone. He puna wai, He puna ora.

                The Three Waters Reform Programme is a major, intergenerational project. It aims to <br> 
                ensure that New Zealand’s three waters - our drinking water, wastewater and <br> 
                stormwater - infrastructure and services are planned, maintained and delivered so that <br> 
                these networks are affordable and fit for purpose. The current situation does not achieve <br> 
                this for all communities. <br> <br>
                Today, on behalf of their communities, 67 different councils own and operate the <br> 
                majority of the drinking water, wastewater and stormwater services across Aotearoa. <br> <br>
                Working with councils, the Government proposes to establish four new publicly - owned <br> 
                multi - regional entities that benefit from scale and operational efficiencies and reflect <br> 
                neighbouring catchments and communities of interest. Central to this plan is our <br> 
                ongoing partnership with the local government sector and mana whenua. <br><br>

                We’re taking a long-term view, building a system that will deliver better health and <br> 
                wellbeing outcomes for our communities and that protects our environment for <br> generations to come. <br><br>

                proposed reforms to New Zealand’s drinking water, wastewater and stormwater <br> services, see the Beehive website.
