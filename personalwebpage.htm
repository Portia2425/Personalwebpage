                The Three Waters Reform Programme is a major, intergenerational project. It aims to <br> ensure that New Zealand’s three waters - our drinking water, wastewater and <br> stormwater - infrastructure and services are planned, maintained and delivered so that <br> these networks are affordable and fit for purpose. The current situation does not achieve <br> this for all communities. <br> <br>
                Today, on behalf of their communities, 67 different councils own and operate the <br> majority of the drinking water, wastewater and stormwater services across Aotearoa. <br> <br>
                Working with councils, the Government proposes to establish four new publicly - owned <br> multi - regional entities that benefit from scale and operational efficiencies and reflect <br> neighbouring catchments and communities of interest. Central to this plan is our <br> ongoing partnership with the local government sector and mana whenua. <br><br>
                To see how these decisions would impact your households three waters services costs,<br> go to your Local Dashboard.<br><br>
                We’re taking a long-term view, building a system that will deliver better health and <br> wellbeing outcomes for our communities and that protects our environment for <br> generations to come. <br><br>
